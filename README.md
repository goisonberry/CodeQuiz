# CodeQuiz

## Purpose

The purpose to of this project is to test the knowledge of users and store their high scores.

### Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

### Process

This project was a test to my previous flaws. I decided to start building a website primarily using event listeners and bootstrap. I decided to use bootstrap as it was difficult for me to utilize in previous projects. The most difficult process in this project was displaying the questions and storing the answers using local storage. It was difficult for me to understand how to utilize local and session storage. However, through many hours of googling and trial and error, I saw that local storage allowed my code to work the way that I needed it to. The only issue I am having right now is displaying the last question. I have been able to mess around with the buttons and changing questions over and over, but the last question just simply does not populate during the quiz. I will be working on how to make the final diaply work as I believe that there is an error in the script.js file that I am not seeing at this moment. However, besides that, the code is working as is should be.
